# Fluent Python Study

This is my deep dive into *Fluent Python* by Luciano Ramalho â€” a journey to master Python's internals, idioms, and real-world patterns.

## ðŸ“š What's Inside

- `tracker.md` â†’ Full 10-week study plan
- `chapters/` â†’ Chapter-by-chapter code, notes, and projects
- `reflections/` â†’ Daily logs and weekly write-ups to reinforce learning
- `concepts/` â†’ Visual diagrams + mental models of tough topics
- `fluentbox/` â†’ My own growing Python library built along the way

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Doing This

To level up as a backend/devtools developer, sharpen my problem-solving, and apply deep Python skills to real-world projects like my DNA Scanner app.
